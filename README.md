# Stellar

'I've been interested in cryptocurrencies since I bought my first fraction of a Bitcoin December 2017. Shortly afterwards, April 2018, I started learning about Stellar and Lumens.

This repository is a collection of modifications to the official example scripts that I use for my own projects. Maybe someone else can borrow something and get past a road block of their own!'
